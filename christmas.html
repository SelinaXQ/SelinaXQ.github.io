            <h2>What is Christmas Delivery?</h2>
            <p class="regular">The first time I joined the social practice department in our college in 2014, we had a new activity which deliver gifts
            bought from our department on Christmas Eve to our classmates and teachers. We gather information through Wechat or QQ which is time-wasting
            because we have to add lots of new friends and note down their information. What's more, we have to check our inventory all the time. So in the next year
            before Christmas Eve, we design our shopping website only used during Christmas.</p>

            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <p class="regular">Here is the sketch we create for the website.</p>
            <img class="img_whole" src="images/christ_sketch.png">

            <h2>Let's move on to the process</h2>
            <p class="regular">Since we only use this website during a specific time, we only have several pages. The most important page must be the homepage.
            We want to attract students to buy our gifts. Also, we need to add some christmas elements to decorate our website.</p>

            <h3>How to attract?</h3>
            <p class="regular">1. Magnify the elements</p>
            <p class="regular">We looked through some shopping website, chose some website which impressed us a lot and analyse them. We found that some of them will magnify the elements, such as a huge gift box placing on
            one side of the website creating a festive atmosphere or set a big dress the background of the navigation. Finally we decide to add a big Christmas tree into our homepage.</p>
            <p class="regular">2. Use different color</p>
            <p class="regular">This is Christmas! We must have three colors - GREEN for Christmas tree, RED for Santa and WHITE for snow! What's more, red is a important color for our Chinese, so we design our big
             Christmas tree in red.</p>

            <h3>Other problems we consider</h3>
            <p class="regular">We only have several products to sell</p>
            <p class="regular">In our department, we have no more than 18 students every year, so we just have 8-10 products like flowers and apples. We intended to have a inventory list first. The list is not long
            but we have to create another page to design it. In order to let customers have a clear look at our products and make our website be more efficient, we decide to put our products
            right on the homepage. We can put the photos of the products on the tree, if you like the product, just click the bell and add it into your shopping cart. It's easy to operate and you don't have to
            jump to another page.</p>
